# Naive Bayes Text Classifier
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier for text classification, specifically designed to classify email messages as "spam" or "ham" (i.e., non-spam).

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
This project requires the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas (only if you want to use it for loading the data)

You can install these prerequisites by using pip, a package manager for Python.




Import the MyClassifier class from the provided Python file into your script.
Initialize an instance of the MyClassifier class.
Call the train method on your instance, providing your training data and corresponding labels as arguments.
Call the predict method on your instance, providing your test data as an argument.
Compare your predictions to the true labels to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

For example:




## Data Format
The classifier expects data in a specific format. Each row in the data should correspond to a message, with the first column representing the label (1 for spam, 0 for ham) and the remaining columns representing the features (i.e., words in this case).

## Methodology
The classifier uses a Naive Bayes approach to predict the class of each message. It calculates the prior probabilities of each class and the likelihoods of each feature (word) being in both classes during the training phase. During the prediction phase, it computes the posterior probabilities of a test instance being in both classes and assigns it to the class with the highest probability.

## Note
It's a good practice to split your data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The validation set is used to tune the parameters of your model and get an idea of its performance during the training phase, while the testing set is used to measure the final performance of your model. This approach avoids overfitting and helps ensure that your model generalizes well.
